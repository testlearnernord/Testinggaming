# Poopboy v0.9

Performance + polish drop.

## Highlights
- Fixed rock placement teleport bug.
- Restored stamina/sprint with UI, smoother regen.
- NPCs wander in front of static houses (Fred, Berta, Stefan).
- Basic shop UI (press **E** near an NPC).
- Day/night tint + radial light for cozy vibes (cheap on GPU).
- Tile culling + y-sort actors for depth.
- Seeds appear in inventory; quick test keys: `1` cabbage, `2` corn, `3` place stone.
